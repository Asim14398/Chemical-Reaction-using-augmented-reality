# Chemical-Reaction-using-augmented-reality
Using AR, students explore the periodic table in 3D. Learners can see how elements bond, observe energy exchanges, and track the reaction's progress through dynamic equations. This hands-on experience enhances understanding of concepts like balancing equations, reaction types, and element reactivity, making complex chemical interactions.
